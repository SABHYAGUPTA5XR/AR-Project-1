# 📱 My First Augmented Reality (AR) Project

This project is my first practical application of **Augmented Reality (AR)**, created after completing the 4-week **Value Added Program** on "**Application Development Using Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality**" conducted by **Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT)**.

The project demonstrates fundamental AR concepts like placing and interacting with virtual 3D objects in the real world.
